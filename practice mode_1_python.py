#Practice using Python to perform calculations and printing results to the screen.

#1.Add the values 1234 and 9876 together and print the result to the screen.

print(1234+9876)

#2.
'''You received a bonus of $1,000 for your outstanding work! You are planning to go to the restaurant to celebrate. You invited your two best friends Alice and Bob. Your dish cost $25, Alice's cost $20 and Bob's cost $30.
How much money do you have left after dinner?
Use subtractions to calculate how much money you have left after paying for dinner. Print the result to the screen.'''

print(1000-25-20-30)

#3.
'''One way to count the number of cells in a table is to multiply the number of rows by the number of columns. Let's use this technique to count the number of cells in the following table:	

 1.Count the number of rows and columns in the above table.
 2.Print the total number of cells by multiplying the two values obtained in step 1.'''

print(3*7)

#4.
'''The body mass index is an attempt to quantify the amount of tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) in an individual, and then categorize that person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on that value.

The body mass index of a person with weight w (in kilograms) and height h (in meters) is calculated as: w/h**2

Use the above formula to compute the body mass index of someone who weighs 66.2 kilograms and has a height of 1.82 meters. Print the result to the screen.'''

print(66.2/(1.82**2))

#5.#
'''The table below shows the crime rates of five U.S. cities. Let's calculate the average crime rate of those five cities. 
City name 	Crime rate
Albuquerque 	749
Anaheim 	371
Anchorage 	828
Arlington 	503
Atlanta 	1379
Calculate the average crime rate of the five cities in the above table and print the result to the screen.'''

print((749+371+828+503+1379)/5)

#6.
'''In this problem, you are given a time of the day and the goal is to calculate the total number of seconds, that have passed since the day started.
Remember that one hour has 3,600 seconds, and one minute has 60 seconds.Using the same way as above, compute the total number of seconds at 12:30. Print the results to the screen.'''

print(12*3600+30*60)

#7.
'''Print to the screen how many muffins will remain after distributing 142 cupcakes evenly between 32 guests.In Python we can calculate the integer division using the // operator:'''
print(142//32)

#8.
'''Print to the screen how many muffins will remain after distributing 142 cupcakes evenly between 32 guests.
we can calculate the remainder of the division using the % operator:'''

print(142%32)

#9.
#Print to the screen the result of converting 30 degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit.
print(((30*9)/5)+32)

#10.
#Print to the screen the result of converting 86 degrees Fahrenheit to Celsius.
print(((86-32)*5)/9)

#11.
#Using a single print statement, print the four values given above into a single line.
print(42, 'times', 17, '=', 42 * 17)
